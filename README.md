# 3DS Saves
My saved games for 3DS - unlocks, finished games, 100%.

For use with e.g. [JKSM](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases):
- Download folder for the game you want (if region doesn't match, try anyway. Most should work anyways)
- Place folder into sdcard:/JKSV/Saves/<Game Name>
- If the table lists ExtData for a game, repeat with sdcard:/JKSV/ExtData/<Game Name>
 - Start JKSM and restore the save and, if applicable, ExtData.

Structure:
```
- Saves
  |- <TitleID>
  |  \- <Game Name as listed in JKSM>
  |     \- <Named directory containing save data>
```
